# Why You Should Shoot in 4k LOG.
## By Jessica Weinberg
### Why using 4k LOG is the ideal combination from an editing perspective. Including discussion about digital zoom wiggle room, logarithmic vs flat pixel distribution, and dynamic range.
#### Target audience of those with an interest in post-production and a basic knowledge of video codecs, resolution, and camera sensors. <br>
##### Introduction
<br> As in editor, it is usually ideal to give yourself as many advantages as possible. One such advantage is allowing the footage to be as malleable as possible to give yourself more ability to manipulate it as needed. 4k footage captured in LOG is the ideal configuration for producing the best possible export because it gives you digital zoom capabilities, helps prevserve pixel information, and more dynamic range in a color suite. Let's take a closer look: <br>
##### What is 4k?
So what does it mean when we talk about shooting in 4k? Well, whenever we capture something with our camera, the footage has a set resolution. These resolution numbers correspond to the number of pixels in the image, meaning that a higher resolution has more pixels. This is important because if we change the size, or aspect ratio, of an image, those with a higher resolution will retain their quality while those with lower resoltuions will quickly beccome pixelated when blown up.<br> 
The standard resolution for most modern screens is 1920x1080, or 1080p, and some screens, especially televisions, have a slightly higher resolution of 2560x1440, or 2k. Although there has been an increase in the popularity of 4k monitors in recent years, there is still a general standard of 1080p or 2k on most screens. Therefore, 4k footage if often downsized to a smaller resolution for the final product, allowing the quality standard to remain high for any aspect ratio adjustments.<br>
